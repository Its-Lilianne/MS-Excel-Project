## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Microsoft Excel report that contains everything I did to come up with the solution for a messy dataset. It outlines the data cleaning steps performed on the 'Excel_DirtyData.xlsx' file. It also outlines deep cleaning, autofitting of the rows and the columns, using the Replace function to correct misspellings, trim extra spaces, and convert the data into a table.
