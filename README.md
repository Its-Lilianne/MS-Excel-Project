# Microsoft Excel Data Cleaning Report
## Introduction
In this project, we’ll be working with a messy dataset that simulates real-world data problems. Your job is to clean and organise the data using Microsoft Excel so it’s ready for analysis. 
Below is the picture of the messy dataset.

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive Microsoft Excel report that contains everything I did to come up with the solution for a messy dataset. It outlines the data cleaning steps performed on the 'Excel_DirtyData.xlsx' file. It also outlines deep cleaning, autofitting of the rows and the columns, using the Replace function to correct misspellings, trim extra spaces, and convert the data into a table.

## Objectives
The goal was to clean and prepare the data for analysis using Microsoft Excel techniques, as described in the project brief, as listed below:
1. Autofit Columns and Rows. 
2. Identify and Remove Duplicates. 
3. Trim Extra Spaces. 
4. Eliminate Blank Cells. 
5. Convert Data into a Table. 
6. Use Find and Replace to correct errors. 
7. Validate data to be sure it is thoroughly clean.

## Report Outline
Key Cleaning Tasks Performed 
1. Autofit Columns and Rows: - This data cleaning is recommended for data visibility in Excel. 
2. Removed Duplicate Records — Ensured all rows are unique

3. Trimmed Extra Spaces — Stripped unnecessary spaces from text entries. To perform this task, I used the MS-Excel “TRIM Function” to trim out the noticeable multiple spaces between names on the “Name Column”; column “C” specifically. To achieve this, I inserted a new column and had to use the “Hide” button to hide the Dirty column after the correction.

4. Eliminated Blank Cells — Dropped all rows with missing values aside from the name “Bruce Banner”. Bruce Banner’s region was not stated, so I assumed it was omitted. Instead of elimination, which would affect other columns like Quality and Price Per Unit, I tagged the cell as “Unknown” by using the “Custom” category in the Format Cells on the Home Tab.

5. Converted 'Price Per Unit' to Numeric — Replaced 'inf' and invalid values. 
6. Corrected Spelling Errors — Fixed misspellings like 'Excelent' to 'Excellent' by using the “REPLACE()” function

7. Validated Data — Checked and cleaned all fields for consistency and accuracy, and finally converted the data into a table by going to the “INSERT” tab, which is after highlighting the spreadsheet or columns. And also added a column titled “Total” by multiplying the Quantity and Price Per Unit columns
